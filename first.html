        <div id="tribute-info"> This page is about a tribute to Ernest Hemingway. My motivation of this tribute comes from his novel "The Old Man
            and the Sea" which i'have read recently. The novel is just magical, movating and an inspiration for everyone.
            some quotes from the book are listed below.
            <p>
                <li>“It's silly not to hope. It's a sin he thought.” </li>
                <li>“Every day is a new day. It is better to be lucky. But I would rather be exact. Then when luck comes you
                    are ready.”</li>
                <li>“But man is not made for defeat," he said. "A man can be destroyed but not defeated.” </li>
                <li>“Now is no time to think of what you do not have. Think of what you can do with that there is” </li>
                <li>“Perhaps I should not have been a fisherman, he thought. But that was the thing that I was born for.” </li>

                <li> Three of his novels, four short story collections, and three non-fiction works were published posthumously.</li>

                    Star, before leaving for the Italian Front to enlist as an ambulance driver in World War I. </li>
                <li>In 1918, he was seriously wounded and returned home. His wartime experiences formed the basis for his novel
                    A Farewell to Arms (1929)</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>In Search of Soulmate</strong>
                    <li>In 1921, he married Hadley Richardson, the first of what would be four wives. The couple moved to Paris,
                        where he worked as a foreign correspondent and fell under the influence of the modernist writers
                        and artists of the 1920s "Lost Generation" expatriate community.</li>
                    <li>His debut novel, The Sun Also Rises, was published in 1926.</li>
                    <li> After his 1927 divorce from Richardson, Hemingway married Pauline Pfeiffer; they divorced after he returned
                        from the Spanish Civil War, where he had been a journalist. He based For Whom the Bell Tolls (1940)
                        on his experience there.</li>
                    <li> Martha Gellhorn became his third wife in 1940; they separated after he met Mary Welsh in London during
                        World War II.</li>
                    <li> He was present at the Normandy landings and the liberation of Paris</li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Last days</strong>
                        <li>Shortly after the publication of The Old Man and the Sea (1952), Hemingway went on safari to Africa,
                            where he was almost killed in two successive plane crashes that left him in pain or ill-health
                            for much of the rest of his life.</li>
                        <li> Hemingway maintained permanent residences in Key West, Florida (in the 1930s) and Cuba (in the 1940s
                            and 1950s).</li>
                        <li> In 1959, he bought a house in Ketchum, Idaho, where, in mid-1961 he shot himself in the head</li>
